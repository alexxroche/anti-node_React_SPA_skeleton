## What is this?

A Single Page Application (SPA) skeleton based on React 16.4.1
It contains everything, (because eventually every CDN fails, eventually), but uses current CDNs for performance.
Layout is orchestrated in CSS by {twitter} Bootstrap


## Why?

The NPM/NPX ecosystem often felt wrong and dangerous [0], but I wanted to try React.js
So to bypass the "Node.js was a mistake!" feeling, this SPA React skeleton doesn't use or require any node.

We can see that in physics a node is a place where nothing useful is happening.
It is the anti-nodes where the vibration and energy exist.

## Dependencies

The included build.sh script requires minify and has only been tested with:

  `minify v2.12.4`

## TODO

Port this to https://mithril.js.org/ to {confirmation bias} show how much faster and smaller mithril.js is
